  "AI_Feedback": "Of course. Based on this data, here is my expert analysis and actionable feedback for the batter.\n\n***\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis is a technically strong foundation. The batter has an outstandingly still head, which is crucial. The main areas for improvement are in achieving full extension through the shot and ensuring the footwork is a platform for balance, not a lunge.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Average Spine Lean: 164.1 degrees**\n\n*   **Feedback:** Your forward lean is good, showing you're committed to getting your weight over the ball and into the shot.\n*   **Actionable Advice:** Let's focus on keeping your chest up just a fraction more as you play the shot. This will perfect your balance and allow for maximum power transfer from your hips.\n\n### **2. Average Head Horizontal Movement: 1.25 pixels**\n\n*   **Feedback:** This is outstanding. Your head is incredibly still through the point of contact, which is a key trait of all elite batters.\n*   **Actionable Advice:** Keep reinforcing this by consciously trying to watch the ball right onto the bat. Think \"chin to the ball\" as a simple cue to keep everything locked in.\n\n### **3. Average Elbow Angle: 122.7 degrees**\n\n*   **Feedback:** We're seeing a slightly bent elbow at contact, which suggests you might be punching at the ball rather than playing through its line.\n*   **Actionable Advice:** Concentrate on leading with a high front elbow and fully extending your arms through impact. Imagine you are \"shaking hands with the bowler\" after contact to encourage a complete follow-through.\n\n### **4. Average Foot Position: 256.97**\n\n*   **Feedback:** Your foot movement shows a very long and committed stride, which gets you to the pitch of the ball.\n*   **Actionable Advice:** Let's work on making that stride slightly shorter and more controlled. Think **\"step, don't lunge\"**\u2014this will keep your head from dipping and ensure you remain balanced to adjust to any late movement."
